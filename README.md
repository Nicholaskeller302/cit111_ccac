## About me
My name is Nicholas Keller and I am majoring in Economics and Entreprenuership. I may also end up getting a minor in creative writing. I am a dealer at Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. My goal in life is to be able to give my future children the life I didn't have and I want to be able to give them the chance to travel. I am an outgoing, friendly, and goal oriented team player who cares about others.
